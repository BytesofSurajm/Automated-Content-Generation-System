from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize pipeline for text generation with GPT-2
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2", tokenizer="gpt2")

def generate_and_save_content(prompt, city="Bangalore", max_length=100):
    # Generate content using the pipeline
    content = generator(prompt, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1)[0]["generated_text"]

    # Create a simple filename based on the first word of the generated content
    filename = f"{city}_{content.split()[0]}.txt"
    filename = re.sub(r'\W+', '_', filename)  # Clean up the filename

    # Save content to file
    with open(filename, "w") as file:
        file.write(content)

    print(f"Content saved to {filename}")

# Example usage
prompt = "A young girl in Bangalore discovers a treasure hidden in the streets of MG Road."
generate_and_save_content(prompt)
